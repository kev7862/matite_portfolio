  <h2>Kevin Matite</h2>
<p><b>I have nearly 3years professionally engaged in a wide range of computer and information technologies -- From design, concept, programming, implementation, analysis, and maintenance.  I have written software in multiple languages, on multiple platforms (and cross platform) for multiple industries.

In addition to a programmer and developer, as a former Radio talk show host, I pose a highly developed lexicon of verbal and written skills.I'm well versed in many skills around technology & product development. I like to build things â€“ usually with technology, and a side of grit. I've worn many hats in my career between executive positions, back-end dev, front-end dev, and product design. I love knowledge, and I strongly believe technology can, and should enrich every single life this universe has to offer. </b></p><img src="photos/IMG_20170115_073533.jpg" alt="kevin"></p>
